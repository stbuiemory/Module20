## üíª Features

```sh
- CSS Framework: Bulma
- Database: MySQL 
- Middleware: Express.js
- Object Relational Mapping: Sequelize
- Password Encryption: bcrypt 
- Session Authentication: express-session npm package
- Template Engine: Handlebars.js
```
## üé¨ Usage

```sh
Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time 
creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend 
at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, 
and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns 
thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, 
where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers‚Äô posts as well. 
You‚Äôll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the
MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, 
Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing

```sh
Unfortunately, this app is still a work in progress.  I had a lot of problems with the 
app itself and also deploying it to Heroku. Please check back at a later time.
```
